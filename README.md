# retropie
Script to get all the Roms I can find.

Working on making this prettier, more efficient, more options etc, basic down and dirty script that
saves you from clicking files one by one, organizes them into known directory names.
WIP

usage:
clone this repository
cd wherever u put it
python get_roms.py

this will create a file in each directory under roms with a download.py for each system
run this and it will download them in that directory.

working on a wrapper, selection for what systems, optional other downloads etc.
